This project is an implementation of linear classifiers: pegasos, perceptron, and average perceptron. 
These algorithms are implemented from scratch, using the hinge loss. See the project1 file for more details on the implementation. 
Here, I classify comments from Amazon costumers using the bag of words approach. 
If you want to take a quick look at the main points of the project, check the jupyter notebook.
